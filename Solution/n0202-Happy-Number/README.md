# 202. Happy Number
## Problem

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy numbers.

Return True if `n` is a happy number, and False if not.

**Example:** 

```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

## Solution

- 见代码，借用快慢指针的思路，也可以用辅助哈希表
